Our framework employs the general minimization-majorization (MM) principle to update each block of variables so as to not only unify the convergence analysis of previous ADMM that use specific surrogate functions in the MM step, but also lead to new efficient ADMM schemes. To the best of our knowledge, in the nonconvex nonsmooth setting, ADMM used in combination with the MM principle to update each block of variables, and ADMM combined with inertial terms for the primal variables have not been studied in the literature.

Since it was first proposed almost two decades ago, multiple computational models have been constructed based on IBLT (i.e., IBL models). These models have been demonstrated to be very successful in explaining and predicting human decisions in multiple decision-making contexts. However, as IBLT has evolved, the initial description of the theory has become less precise, and it is unclear how its demonstration can be expanded to more complex, dynamic, and multi-agent environments. This paper presents an updated version of the current theoretical components of IBLT in a comprehensive and precise form. It also provides an advanced implementation of the full set of theoretical mechanisms, SpeedyIBL, to unlock the capabilities of IBLT to handle a diverse taxonomy of individual and multi-agent decision-making problems. SpeedyIBL addresses a practical computational issue in past implementations of IBL models, the curse of exponential growth, that emerges from memory-based tabular computations. When more observations accumulate over time, there is an exponential growth of the memory of instances that leads directly to an exponential slowdown of the computational time. Thus, SpeedyIBL leverages parallel computation with vectorization to speed up the execution time of IBL models. We evaluate the robustness of SpeedyIBL over an existing implementation of IBLT in decision games of increased complexity. The results not only demonstrate the applicability of IBLT through a wide range of decision-making tasks, but also highlight the improvement of SpeedyIBL over its prior implementation as the complexity of decision features the of agents increase. The library is open sourced for the use of the broad research community.","tags":null,"title":"SpeedyIBL: A comprehensive, precise, and fast implementation of instance-based learning theory","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Le Thi Khanh Hien","Duy Nhat Phan","Nicolas Gillis","Masoud Ahookhosh","and Panagiotis Patrinos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1646511232,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646511232,"objectID":"cec9bf9fed02348803591cbfbdc593bc","permalink":"https://nhatpd.github.io/publication/jhien_siam_2022/","publishdate":"2022-03-05T20:13:52.626042Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jhien_siam_2022/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we consider a class of nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problems whose objective is the sum of a block relative smooth function and a proper and lower semicontinuous block separable function.

Taking our inspiration from Nesterov-type acceleration and the majorization-minimization scheme, we propose a block alternating Bregman majorization minimization framework with extrapolation (BMME).

When the data possesses certain group structures in which individual variables are also meaningful scientifically, we are naturally interested in selecting important groups as well as important variables within the selected groups. This is referred to as the bi-level variable selection which is much more complex than the selection of individual variables. In recent years, research on the topic of variable selection is very active, but the majority of the work is focused on the individual variable selection. There is therefore a need to further develop more effective approaches for bi-level variable selection. Since DC (Difference of Convex functions) programming and DCA (DC Algorithm), powerful tools in nonconvex programming framework, have been successfully investigated for individual variable selection, we believe that they could be efficiently exploited for the more difficult bi-level variable selection task. In that direction, we investigate in this work DC approximations of the mixed zero norm L_0,0 and the combined norm L_0,0+L_q,0. The resulting approximate problems are then formulated as DC programs for which DCA based algorithms are introduced. As an application, these DCA schemes are developed for estimating multiple sparse covariance matrices sharing some common structures such as the locations or weights of non-zero elements. The experimental results on both simulated and real datasets indicate the efficiency of our algorithms.","tags":null,"title":"DCA based approaches for bi-level variable selection and application for estimate multiple sparse covariance matrices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hoai An Le Thi","Hoai Minh Le","Duy Nhat Phan","BachTran"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1636934400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636934400,"objectID":"aa57004696f560dd6be67cd3c536687c","permalink":"https://nhatpd.github.io/publication/jan_amc_2021/","publishdate":"2021-11-15T20:13:52.626042Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jan_amc_2021/","section":"publication","summary":"We address the problem of minimizing the sum of a nonconvex, differentiable function and composite functions by DC (Difference of Convex functions) programming and DCA (DC Algorithm), powerful tools of nonconvex optimization.

We first develop a standard DCA scheme especially dealing with the very specific structure of this problem. Furthermore, we extend DCA to give rise to the so-named DCA-Like, which is based on a new and efficient way to approximate the DC objective function without knowing a DC decomposition. We further improve DCA based algorithms by incorporating the Nesterov’s acceleration technique into them. The convergence properties and the convergence rate under Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz assumption of extended DCAs are rigorously studied. We prove that DCA-Like and the accelerated versions subsequently converge from every initial point to a critical point of the considered problem.

Our algorithm iteratively computes the proximal operator of a reweighted nuclear norm which has a closed-form solution by performing the SVD of a smaller matrix instead of the full SVD. This distinguishes our work from recent accelerated proximal gradient algorithms that require an expensive computation of the proximal operator of nonconvex nonsmooth composite functions.

For 35 years from their birthday, these theoretical and algorithmic tools have been greatly enriched, thanks to a lot of their applications, by researchers and practitioners in the world, to model and successfully solve nonconvex programs from many fields of applied sciences. Despite these bright successes, how to further exploit the full power and creative freedom offered by these tools to more advantageously improve the state of the art (the standard) Difference-of-Convex functions algorithm to better handle large scale problems and big data is still a great challenge in this field. This paper addresses the three most important key issues to meet this challenge: finding tailored Difference of Convex functions decompositions, speeding up convergence, and reducing the computational burden of the standard Difference-of-Convex functions algorithm. Several advanced algorithms are proposed: the successive Difference-of-Convex decomposition algorithm in which Difference-of-Convex components are successively changed, its inexact version, and the accelerated versions via Nesterov's acceleration technique of the two former approaches. Convergence properties of the proposed algorithms are carefully studied. We prove that, fortunately, in spite of these modifications, the proposed advanced algorithms have similar convergence properties to the standard algorithm. Moreover, we establish their convergence rates with Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz assumption. Finally, we demonstrate that various popular methods are special cases of the proposed algorithms.","tags":null,"title":"Advanced Difference-of-Convex functions Algorithms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hoai An Le Thi","Hoai Minh Le","Duy Nhat Phan","BachTran"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1608063232,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608063232,"objectID":"7f34b968d0280f4caa0906a2426bf13e","permalink":"https://nhatpd.github.io/publication/jan_neura_2021/","publishdate":"2020-12-15T20:13:52.626042Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jan_neura_2021/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider the large sum of DC (Difference of Convex) functions minimization problem which appear in several different areas, especially in stochastic optimization and machine learning.

Furthermore, we develop our stochastic DCA for solving an important problem in multi-task learning, namely group variables selection in multi class logistic regression.

In this paper, we consider the -norm regularization for enforcing group sparsity and investigate a DC (Difference of Convex functions) approximation approach for solving the -norm regularization problem. We show that, with suitable parameters, the original and approximate problems are equivalent. Considering two equivalent formulations of the approximate problem we develop DC programming and DCA (DC Algorithm) for solving them. As an application, we implement the proposed algorithms for group variable selection in the optimal scoring problem. The sparsity is obtained by using the -regularization that selects the same features in all discriminant vectors. The resulting sparse discriminant vectors provide a more interpretable low-dimensional representation of data.

The proposed algorithm, named Accelerated DCA (ADCA), consists in incorporating the Nesterov’s acceleration technique into DCA. We first investigate ADCA for solving the standard DC program and rigorously study its convergence properties and the convergence rate. Secondly, we develop ADCA for a special case of the standard DC program whose the objective function is the sum of a differentiable function with L-Lipschitz continuous gradient (possibly nonconvex) and a DC function. We exploit the special structure of the problem to propose an efficient DC decomposition for which the corresponding ADCA scheme is inexpensive. As an application, we consider the sparse binary logistic regression problem. Numerical experiments on several benchmark datasets illustrate the efficiency of our algorithm and its superiority over well-known methods.","tags":null,"title":"Accelerated Difference of Convex functions Algorithm and its Application to Sparse Binary Logistic Regression","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\u0026hellip;\n","date":1530140400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530140400,"objectID":"18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41","permalink":"https://nhatpd.github.io/privacy/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/privacy/","section":"","summary":"\u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Privacy Policy","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\u0026hellip;\n","date":1530140400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530140400,"objectID":"9b10c1f64082d3869fd4cb1f85809430","permalink":"https://nhatpd.github.io/terms/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/terms/","section":"","summary":"\u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Terms","type":"page"},{"authors":["Duy Nhat Phan","Hoai An Le Thi","Tao Pham Dinh"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1509494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509494400,"objectID":"cd2747c2a2e40211a5443cf3b7ea1509","permalink":"https://nhatpd.github.io/publication/jnhat_neura_2017/","publishdate":"2017-11-01T20:13:52.626042Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jnhat_neura_2017/","section":"publication","summary":"This letter proposes a novel approach using the -norm regularization for the sparse covariance matrix estimation (SCME) problem. The objective function of SCME problem is composed of a nonconvex part and the term, which is discontinuous and difficult to tackle. Appropriate DC (difference of convex functions) approximations of -norm are used that result in approximation SCME problems that are still nonconvex. DC programming and DCA (DC algorithm), powerful tools in nonconvex programming framework, are investigated. Two DC formulations are proposed and corresponding DCA schemes developed. Two applications of the SCME problem that are considered are classification via sparse quadratic discriminant analysis and portfolio optimization. A careful empirical experiment is performed through simulated and real data sets to study the performance of the proposed algorithms.
